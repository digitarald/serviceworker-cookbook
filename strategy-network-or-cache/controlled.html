  <p>This image request originates from a controlled page so the image will
    be served by the service worker. The service worker will try to retrieve
    the most updated content from network but if the answer does not arrive
    before a time window, it will fall back to the cached content. Try to adjust
    throttling to GPRS to see the effects of network latency.</p>
